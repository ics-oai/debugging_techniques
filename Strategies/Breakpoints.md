**Breakpoints** - Breakpoints are temporary markers that you place in your executable program to tell the [[Debugger|debugger]] to stop your program at a given point.

# Functionality
When the debugger encounters a breakpoint, the debugger suspends execution at the breakpoint before it executes the statement. At this point, you can you can see the stack for the thread and check the contents of variables, registers, and memory. Then, you can step over (execute) the statement and see what effect it has on the argument.
