# Definition
**Test Driven Development** - Test Driven Development is a process that converts your project requirements into thorough test cases before development starts. Doing so makes developing your program easier because you can focus on achieving smaller, intermediate goals (passing the test cases one at a time) rather than tackling one large, ambiguous goal (writing the program as a whole).
