# Debugging Techniques
This is the [ICS OAI](https://oai.ics.uci.edu/) debugging techniques guide. Currently, the code exercises and examples focus on Python, but some elements relevant to C++ are included. However, the overall techniques are applicable to programming in general. If you need additional help debugging, feel free to make an [appointment](https://campusgroups.uci.edu/feeds?type=club&type_id=71392&topic_id=0) with a learning mentor.
