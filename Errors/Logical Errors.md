# Definition
**Logical Errors** - A logical error, also known as a semantic error, is a type of programming error in which the code is syntactically correct and executes without raising any exceptions, but it does not produce the intended or correct result due to a flaw in the program's logic or algorithm. These errors are often subtle and require careful analysis to identify and correct because they stem from incorrect assumptions or flawed reasoning in the program's design.
