# Definition
**Run-Time Errors** - Run-Time Errors occur during the execution of a Python program. These errors are not detected until the program is running and actively performing operations. Run-time errors can be caused by various factors, such as incorrect data types, invalid operations, or issues related to the program's logic. They must be handled using error-handling techniques like try-except blocks.
